# ðŸ”” Assignment 

Now that we've seen how to interface ARM with FPGA, how about adding the peripheral you created in assignment 2 (the `peripheral_led`) and controlling the FPGA LEDs via Linux with your own peripheral?

1. Modify Platform Designer by adding your IP
   - Note the address 
1. Compile the project, generate the `.rbf` and `.dtb` (copy to the SD card)
1. Modify `main.c` to access your peripheral
1. Test

## Note:

This extra assignment counts as a bonus for grade A (that is, those who do it are benefited and those who don't want to, that's fine!)

Essa entrega extra entra como uma nota a mais na mÃ©dia de valor A (ou seja, quem
fez Ã© beneficiado e quem nÃ£o quer fazer, tudo bem!)
