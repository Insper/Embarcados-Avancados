# Overview

The final project for the course should be a tutorial related to at least one learning objective of the subject:

- Formulate solutions that meet hardware and software requirements for FPGA-SoC (System-on-a-chip) projects
- Integrate a prototype solution for an embedded system with processing and/or real-time requirements via FPGA-SoC
- Interface different modules in an embedded system (processors, firmware, and operating system)

## Areas

Some examples of areas that can be explored:

1. Acceleration/implementation of some algorithm in hardware
    - data processing, FFT, compression, cryptography, ...
    - HLD/HLS/OpenCL/Amazon FPGA
1. Performance comparison between different technologies  
    - SoC vs GPU vs FPGA vs uC
1. Operating system 
    - Real-time scheduler, Linux kernel, Android, embedded RTOS
